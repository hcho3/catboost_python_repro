Goal: Reverse-engineer Catboost model object so that we can run prediction with it

1. Install Catboost:
   pip install catboost
2. Install CityHash:
   pip install clickhouse-cityhash
3. Download the Adult data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult. Get the files
   adult.data and adult.test and place them in the same directory as the training script train.py.
4. Run train.py to fit the Catboost model on the Adult dataset. The script will save the model
   as a JSON file named adult_model.json.
5. Finally, run preprocessing_prototype.py to inspect the preprocessing steps in Catboost.
   You may want to study the Python script more carefully to understand all details.
